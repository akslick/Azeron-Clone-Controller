# WASD-joystick-gamepad
Forked from AnonEngineering/Azeron-Clone-Controller

Code will run on any arduino capable of emulating a HID device (keyboard or mouse) over usb: Leonardo, Micro, Pro-Micro, Elite-C, etc...

Started with the sample code for a 3D printed clone of the Azeron Game Pad controller by AnonEngineering

I have tested it to work on a Pro-Micro and Elite-C without issues.

# Current Status
Works perfectly with 8 directions

# todos 
- create calibration method for joystick trigger by key combo or other button input
- emulate PWM (pulse width modulation to add more than 8 functional directions)
